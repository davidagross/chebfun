function f = simplify(f, tol)
%SIMPLIFY  Remove small trailing Fourier coeffs of a happy TRIGTECH object.
%  G = SIMPLIFY(F) attempts to compute a 'simplified' version G of the happy
%  TRIGTECH object F such that LENGTH(G) <= LENGTH(F) but ||G - F|| is small in
%  a relative sense. It does this by calling the routine STANDARDCHOP.
%
%  If F is not happy, F is returned unchanged.
%
%  G = SIMPLIFY(F, TOL) does the same as above but uses TOL instead of
%  EPS.

% See also STANDARDCHOP.

% STANDARDCHOP requires at least 17 coefficients, so for F such that LENGTH(F) <
% 17, the coefficients are padded using prolong. The following
% parameters are chosen explicitly to work with STANDARDCHOP.
% See STANDARDCHOP for details.
nold = length(f);
N = max(17, round(nold*1.25 + 5));
f = prolong(f,N);

% Grab the coefficients of F.
coeffs = abs(f.coeffs(end:-1:1,:));
[n, m] = size(coeffs);
coeffs = trigtech.vals2coeffs(trigtech.coeffs2vals(coeffs));

% Use the default tolerance if none was supplied.
p = chebfunpref;

    tol = p.eps;
end

% Reshape TOL.
if ( size(tol, 2) ~= m )
    tol = max(max(tol),p.eps)*ones(1, m);
end

% In order to work with STANDARDCHOP, the coefficients of F are modified so that
% the entries corresponding to wave numbers k and -k appear sequentially in the
% new matrix of coefficients. These entries are also replaced by the sum of the
% absolute values of the k and -k coefficients.

% Need to handle odd/even cases separately.

end
coeffs = flipud(coeffs);
coeffs = [coeffs(1,:) ; kron(coeffs(2:end,:),[1 ; 1])];

for k = 1:m
    cutoff = max(cutoff, standardChop(coeffs(:,k), tol(k)));
